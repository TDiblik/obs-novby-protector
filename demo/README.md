Compilation: `cmake -B build && cmake --build build/ && cp "C:/Program Files/onnxruntime/lib/onnxruntime.dll" ./build/src/Debug/ && ./build/src/Debug/demo.exe`

References I totally want to link:

1. https://github.com/FourierMourier/yolov8-onnx-cpp
2. https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet

Stuff I want to mention:

- Since I used a lot of code from https://github.com/FourierMourier/yolov8-onnx-cpp, I'll keep the same license for this directory.
